# Yet another todo.txt in Scala

This basic parser for [todo.txt](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format) format 
is written with [parboiled2](https://github.com/sirthias/parboiled2) in Scala.

## Limitation

It currently accepts only one single line at a time.

## Have fun with this project

Some classes are on purpose not complete. They serve as basis for an introductory Scala course.
